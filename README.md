> The title screen. Nothing much to say here besides the somewhat cryptic blurring of the background. Same background is used for the background image for the certain controller/displays.

> This is what the in game screen would look like. User information is displayed in another window along with other team information. If an enemy or remote target is selected, they will show in the "Lead" boxes. The different tiles represent a different biomes which also influence player movement and line of sight. Water represents the lowest biome which is depicted as blue, brown represent higher regions such as mountain peaks which can target any lower region given the character has enough range.
